# G8 HOTELS Management System

## Overview

G8 HOTELS Management System is a simple C++ console application for managing hotel guest information. It allows two types of users: **Admin** and **Guest**. Admins can add, update, or delete guest information and view a general overview, while guests can book rooms and submit.



All actions and information are logged to a file named `hotel.txt`.

## Features

  - Add guest information
  - Update guest information (placeholder)
  - Delete guest information

- **Guest Functions:**

  - All user interactions and data are saved to `hotel.txt`

## How to Run
